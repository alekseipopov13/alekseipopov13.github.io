                The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been breed
                for centures to herd and protect sheep. The breed was used bu the
                French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers
                because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World
                War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is
                slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and
                Lafayette all owned briards. <br>
